the components.

-Google maps API to find bars and restaurants by geolocation.

9/22/16- I decided to have App.jsx house all of the routes for Secret spots. When the user first goes to the page, they will be prompted to sign in or register in order to access the dashboard.

I also decided on using an object oriented approach to the design because it made sense to me to have each aspect be it's own object. That's how I'm able to envision this app. The goal will be to make this a single page application so that it is seamless to the user. I really like this approach. My goal for today will be to set up the Home page, authorization requirements and the other components that I will need to make post requests and create users/posts.
